There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Tag Angler

## Sub-Heading ##
  YouTube search engine optimization made easy.

## Summary ##
  This app makes it easy to tag your YouTube videos effectively. You can look up any topic, and you
  will be provided a sorted list of the most common tags for that topic. If you attach these tags
  to your video, it will be found more often by viewers.

## Problem ##
  Deciding on what tags to use for your video can be hard, because you don't know what viewers 
  will be typing into the search bar. You might even be inclined to just type the title of
  your video into the tags and be done with it. However, video tags are one of the few things
  that you choose that can have a real effect on the results of YouTube's search algorithm.
  By not optimizing those tags, you are significantly reducing your viewership.

## Solution ##
  In order to generate a list of optimal tags, this app will find the most popular videos 
  for a topic, collect their tags, find the ones that are most frequently used, and
  display the most common ones and how many times they were used.

## Quote from You ##
  "As a YouTube content creator myself, I built this so that I could use it in my own day to day 
  life."

## How to Get Started ##
  You just go to TagAngler.com, sign in, and type in your topic. It's that easy.

## Customer Quote ##
  "After using tag angler, my viewership has only gone up!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  "You have nothing to lose. Head over to TagAngler.com to get started!"
